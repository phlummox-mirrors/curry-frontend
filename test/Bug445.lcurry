I don't know if it's really a bug or I only don't understand records well.
The following gives a compiling error:

> fun :: a -> Bool
> fun _ = True

> fun3 :: a -> a -> Bool
> fun3 _ _ = False

> type Rec a = { a :: a, b :: Bool }

> testRecSel1 = { a := 'c', b := True } :> a

> testRecSel2 x y = { a := fun x, b := fun3 y y } :> a

The type of the record used in testRecSel1 somehow propagates
to the type of the record used in testRecSel2.
If one comments the definition of testRecSel1 then there is no error.
