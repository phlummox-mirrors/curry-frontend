\section{Utility Functions}
The module \texttt{Utils} provides a few simple functions that are
commonly used in the compiler, but not implemented in the Haskell
\texttt{Prelude} or standard library.
\begin{verbatim}

> module Base.Utils
>   ( fst3, thd3, (++!), foldr2, mapAccumM, findDouble, concatMapM, findMultiples
>   , without, zip', zipWith', zipWith3', fromJust'
>   ) where

> import Data.List (partition)

> infixr 5 ++!

\end{verbatim}
\paragraph{Triples}
The \texttt{Prelude} does not contain standard functions for
triples. We provide projection, (un-)currying, and mapping for triples
here.
\begin{verbatim}

> fst3 :: (a, b, c) -> a
> fst3 (x, _, _) = x

snd3 :: (a, b, c) -> b
snd3 (_, y, _) = y

> thd3 :: (a, b, c) -> c
> thd3 (_, _, z) = z

apFst3 :: (a -> d) -> (a, b, c) -> (d, b, c)
apFst3 f (x, y, z) = (f x, y, z)

apSnd3 :: (b -> d) -> (a, b, c) -> (a, d, c)
apSnd3 f (x, y, z) = (x, f y, z)

apThd3 :: (c -> d) -> (a, b, c) -> (a, b, d)
apThd3 f (x, y, z) = (x, y, f z)

curry3 :: ((a, b, c) -> d) -> a -> b -> c -> d
curry3 f x y z = f (x, y, z)

uncurry3 :: (a -> b -> c -> d) -> (a, b, c) -> d
uncurry3 f (x, y, z) = f x y z

\end{verbatim}
\paragraph{Lists}
The function \texttt{(++!)} is variant of the list concatenation
operator \texttt{(++)} that ignores the second argument if the first
is a non-empty list. When lists are used to encode non-determinism in
Haskell, this operator has the same effect as the cut operator in
Prolog, hence the \texttt{!} in the name.
\begin{verbatim}

> (++!) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
> xs ++! ys = if null xs then ys else xs

\end{verbatim}
\paragraph{Strict fold}
The function \texttt{foldl\_strict} is a strict version of
\texttt{foldl}, i.e., it evaluates the binary applications before
the recursion. This has the advantage that \texttt{foldl\_strict} does
not construct a large application which is then evaluated in the base
case of the recursion.
\begin{verbatim}

foldl_strict :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
foldl_strict = foldl'

\end{verbatim}
\paragraph{Folding with two lists}
Fold operations with two arguments lists can be defined using
\texttt{zip} and \texttt{foldl} or \texttt{foldr}, resp. Our
definitions are unfolded for efficiency reasons.
\begin{verbatim}

foldl2 :: (a -> b -> c -> a) -> a -> [b] -> [c] -> a
foldl2 _ z []       _        = z
foldl2 _ z _        []       = z
foldl2 f z (x : xs) (y : ys) = foldl2 f (f z x y) xs ys

> foldr2 :: (a -> b -> c -> c) -> c -> [a] -> [b] -> c
> foldr2 _ z []       _        = z
> foldr2 _ z _        []       = z
> foldr2 f z (x : xs) (y : ys) = f x y (foldr2 f z xs ys)

\end{verbatim}
\paragraph{Monadic fold with an accumulator}
The function \texttt{mapAccumM} is a generalization of
\texttt{mapAccumL} to monads like \texttt{foldM} is for
\texttt{foldl}.
\begin{verbatim}

> mapAccumM :: Monad m => (a -> b -> m (a, c)) -> a -> [b] -> m (a, [c])
> mapAccumM _ s []       = return (s, [])
> mapAccumM f s (x : xs) = do
>   (s' , y ) <- f s x
>   (s'', ys) <- mapAccumM f s' xs
>   return (s'', y : ys)

\end{verbatim}
\paragraph{Monadic concatMap}
The function \texttt{concatMapM} is a generalization of
\texttt{concatMap} to monads like \texttt{foldM} is for
\texttt{foldl}.
\begin{verbatim}

> concatMapM :: Monad m => (a -> m [b]) -> [a] -> m [b]
> concatMapM f xs = mapM f xs >>= return . concat

\end{verbatim}
The function \texttt{findDouble} checks whether a list of entities is
linear, i.e., if every entity in the list occurs only once. If it is
non-linear, the first offending object is returned.
\begin{verbatim}

> findDouble :: Eq a => [a] -> Maybe a
> findDouble []   = Nothing
> findDouble (x : xs)
>   | x `elem` xs = Just x
>   | otherwise   = findDouble xs

> findMultiples :: Eq a => [a] -> [[a]]
> findMultiples []       = []
> findMultiples (x : xs)
>   | null same = multiples
>   | otherwise = (x : same) : multiples
>   where (same, other) = partition (==x) xs
>         multiples     = findMultiples other

\end{verbatim}
A function that returns the given list without the nth element
\begin{verbatim}

> without :: [a] -> Int -> [a]
> without xs n = 
>   if n >= length xs || n < 0
>   then error "without: index out of range" 
>   else without' 0 xs
>   where
>   without' n' (y:ys) | n' == n   = without' (n' + 1) ys
>                      | otherwise = y : without' (n' + 1) ys 
>   without' _ [] = []

\end{verbatim}
Zipping lists as with zip/zipWith, but throw an error if the lists don't have 
the same length
\begin{verbatim}

> zip' :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
> zip' (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x, y) : zip' xs ys
> zip' []     []     = []
> zip' _      _      = error "zip': lists don't have the same length!"

> zipWith' :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
> zipWith' _ []     []     = []
> zipWith' f (x:xs) (y:ys) = f x y : zipWith' f xs ys
> zipWith' _ _      _      = error "zipWith': lists don't have same length"

> zipWith3' :: (a -> b -> c -> d) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c] -> [d]
> zipWith3' _ []     []     []     = []
> zipWith3' f (x:xs) (y:ys) (z:zs) = f x y z : zipWith3' f xs ys zs
> zipWith3' _ _      _      _      = error "zipWith3': lists don't have same length"

\end{verbatim} 

\begin{verbatim}

> -- |Like fromJust, only displays the given error string if applied to Nothing. 
> -- Useful for debugging. 
> fromJust' :: String -> Maybe a -> a
> fromJust' _ (Just x) = x
> fromJust' s Nothing  = error ("fromJust': " ++ s)

\end{verbatim}
